There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Is This a Stupid Question? 

## Sub-Heading ##
  > For the person who wants to ask the right questions.

## Summary ##
  > This application hopes to force a user to ask themselves, every time they want to ask a question, whether a question is good or not. Ideally, after using the application, the user will be able to re-word vague, senseless questions into ones that are succint, have a clear point, and will promote deep thinking. 

## Problem ##
  > People will tell you that there is no such thing as a stupid question. They're lying. Too often, we ask questions that are just plain stupid. These questions pose two problems: those that ask it are perceived as having a lesser intelligence and those that are asked it are quick to judge the person who asked it. 

## Solution ##
  > This application will use results from a web search of your question to determine whether or not that question is valid or not. If it passes our complex test, you can be assured that it is not a stupid question. If your question fails, you know not to ask it, and to refactor that stupid question into a smart one. 

## Quote from You ##
  > Sebastian Dharithreesan, Chief Meowketing Officer, says "This application targets a broad audience. Everyone can use it to structure any type of question, from personal to technical to academic, into one that will reap the most rewards. "

## How to Get Started ##
  > Getting started is as easy as typing in your question into the input box and clicking submit. The application will then respond with a YES or NO. If the question is not stupid (NO), the top links from the search will also show up. The user can ask as many questions as they want and their total Stupid/ Not Stupid questions will be logged. 

## Customer Quote ##
  > Annie Tran, a customer of 'Is This a Stupid Question?' has this to say: "This website really helped me discover how to ask the right questions. Now, instead of my colleagues avoiding me whenever I have to ask a question, they are willing to answer. I also found that this application helped me use web search websites more effectively, which reduced the amount of time i spent combing through search results."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > The goal of this application is not to make a user feel inept. Rather, it is to guide them into being a more effective communicator. Using this application will help them filter their question in a safe environment and when they finally get that YES, they have a question worth asking.  If the user finds themselves asking a lot of stupid questions, they will find value in looking at http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/how-amazingly-good-asking-questions.html
