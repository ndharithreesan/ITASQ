 
# Is This a Stupid Question? #

### For the person who wants to ask the right questions.###


## Summary ##
  > This application hopes to force a user to ask themselves, every time they want to ask a question, whether a question is good or not. Ideally, after using the application, the user will be able to re-word vague, senseless questions into ones that are succint, have a clear point, and will promote deep thinking. 

## Problem ##
  > People will tell you that there is no such thing as a stupid question. They're lying. Too often, we ask questions that are just plain stupid. These questions pose two problems: those that ask it are perceived as having a lesser intelligence and those that are asked it are quick to judge the person who asked it. 

## Solution ##
  > This application will use results from a web search of your question to determine whether or not that question is valid or not. If it passes our complex test, you can be assured that it is not a stupid question. If your question fails, you know not to ask it, and to refactor that stupid question into a smart one. 

## How to Get Started ##
  > Getting started is as easy as typing in your question into the input box and clicking submit. The application will then respond with a YES or NO. If the question is not stupid (NO), the top links from the search will also show up. The user can ask as many questions as they want and their total Stupid/ Not Stupid questions will be logged. 

## Company quote ##
  > Sebastian Dharithreesan, Chief Meowketing Officer, says "This application targets a broad audience. Everyone can use it to structure any type of question, from personal to technical to academic, into one that will reap the most rewards. "

## Customer Quote ##
  > Annie Tran, a customer of 'Is This a Stupid Question?' has this to say: "This website really helped me discover how to ask the right questions. Now, instead of my colleagues avoiding me whenever I have to ask a question, they are willing to answer. I also found that this application helped me use web search websites more effectively, which reduced the amount of time i spent combing through search results."

  #The goal of this application is not to make a user feel inept. Rather, it is to guide them into being a more effective communicator. Using this application will help them filter their question in a safe environment and when they finally get that YES, they have a question worth asking.
